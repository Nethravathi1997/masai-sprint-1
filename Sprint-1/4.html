            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Nal Sarovar Bird Sanctuary, consisting primarily of a 120.82-square-kilometre (46.65 sq mi) lake and ambient marshes,
                 is situated about 64 km to the west of Ahmedabad near Sanand Village, in the Gujarat state of India. Mainly inhabited
                  by migratory birds in winter and spring, it is the largest wetland bird sanctuary in Gujarat,
                 and one of the largest in India. It was declared a bird sanctuary in April 1969 <br> <br>
                 Hours for visiting the lake are 6 am to 5:30 pm. There is an entry fee per visitor and camera, 
                 however for boating one needs to negotiate with the local boatmen, though prescribed rates are mentioned at the gate. 
                 The best time to reach there is just before sunrise as the lake is calm and quiet and flock of birds waiting for their regular food.
                  The water in the lake is about 4 feet deep. Visitors can take a horse ride with a number of horses at the lakeside

                 Gujarat and East Saurashtra. Although the number of islands in Nal Sarovar bird sanctuary are debatable,
                 the official records mention 36 small islands, while locals estimate more than 100 small islands.
                 This sanctuary consists of various kinds of trees,including the locally famous ‘pilu’ trees which harbour a red 
                 berry type edible fruit.There are many small lakes and the vegetation is scattered with dense forests, marshlands & wetlands,
                 medium to tall grasslands and huge fields.
