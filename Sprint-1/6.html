            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Vedanthangal Bird Sanctuary is a 30-hectare (74-acre) protected area located in the Chengalpattu District 
                and Madurantakam taluk of the state of Tamil Nadu, India. The sanctuary is about 75 kilometres (47 mi) from 
                Chennai on National Highway 45 ([NH45]). Easily reachable from Madurantakam and Chengalpattu. More than 40,000 birds (including 26 rare species),
                 from various parts of the world visit the sanctuary during the migratory season every year <br> <br>
                 Vedanthangal in Tamil language means 'hamlet of the hunter'. This area was a favourite
                  hunting spot of the local landlords in the early 18th century. The region attracted a variety
                of birds because it was dotted with small lakes that acted as feeding grounds for the birds.
                 Realising its ornithological importance, the British government undertook steps to develop Vedanthangal into
                  a bird sanctuary as early as 1798.
                  This was established in 1858 by the order of the Collector of Chengalpattu.
